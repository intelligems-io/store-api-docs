# Getting Started with IntelliGems

### Overview

The IntelliGems API will enable you to run experiments in your virtual store. You can use these endpoints to configure your store and will also be used to render the items in your store.

> The IntelliGems dashboard will be the destination for all item and experiment configurations. However, for now, we will use the configure endpoints.
